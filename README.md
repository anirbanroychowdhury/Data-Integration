# Data-Integration
We will be integrating data from various different files such as csv, excel, pdf , xml to create a uniformed source of data which can be used for modelling.
We will  also be seeing the effect of some data transformation and scalling such as Z-score normalization, Power transformation, Min-max transformation, etc.
